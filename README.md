# AOC_2022

I'm doing Advent of Code with the objective of learning and becoming better at Rust. It'll be interesting to see my progress through various days.

Below will be a log of how I felt about each day. 

### Day 1
Challenges: 
- Basically everything. I am learning all the syntax of the language at the same time
- After watching ThePrimagen teach Theo how to do today's challenge, I realized that I am lacking a fundamental understanding of various functional programming things. Also lacking basic understanding of maps and things of this nature. Going to study later to help with understanding.
